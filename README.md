- 👋 Hi, I’m @rushabhshah1027 . This is just my username. My actual name Rushabh Shah.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing solutions in Pega platform and Pega CDH versions. I also like to create blogs on my blogsite: https://pegalearnwithrs.blogspot.com/
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on installing Pega Platform in MacOS. I have been using windows laptop and it was pretty straight forward installation process however installing in MacOS is very difficult as Pegasystems only gave files for AMD64/x86 based architecture and not for ARM based architecture. There are several ways of installing this in MacOS that I am currently finding solution for.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with any Pega/Java professionals 
- 📫 How to reach me . You can simply reach out to me on LinkedIn via https://www.linkedin.com/in/rushabh-shah-b4a1b3167/ OR send an email on rushabh1027@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Here are few Niches: 1. I went to CVS pharmacy randomly to pick my fever medicine, I saw famous bollywood star with her bodyguard which astonished me for 1 min but I met her :D. 2. If you ask me where would you go if I have super power ? I will go to my childhood and enjoy my life there. You will enjoy that energy, time, responsibility in those days.
